# Planning
First I worked on the user stories, and how i wanted the users to experience while using the application.
Then I worked on wireframes and the layout of what I wanted my application to look like to the user.
Next I created the Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD) in which I mapped out my models which consited of users,
questions, andswers (front-end in developing process). I used problem solving capabilities to debug and solve problems.

# User Stories
1. User is able to create questions
2. User can update
3. User can delete
4. User can view their own questions and others

# Technologies Used

- React.js
